# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammad Mofidikhajeh

🎓 I'm a master's student in **Computer Science – Data Mining** at Tarbiat Modares University, with a deep interest in data science, machine learning, and deep learning.

🚀 I transitioned from a background in Radiation Therapy to tech, and over the last few years, I've built hands-on experience in:
- **Python, SQL, and Git**
- **Machine Learning** with Scikit-learn
- **Deep Learning** using PyTorch (MLP, CNN, RNN, Transformer)
- **Data Analysis & Visualization** with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Interactive dashboards** with Streamlit

I will be putting most of my class projects here, so feel free to use them as a reference for implimentation if you're taking similar classes :)
